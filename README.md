Took the input as code comments/snippets and processed
them to tokenize and worked on transformers-based models
like Bahdanau and Luong.

Addressed the problem of automated exploit generation through
NLP. Obtained BLEU score of 75.5 with Loung attention mech-
anism on the Shellcode dataset.

Deployed it using Flask.
